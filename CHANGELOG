version 0.0.18 (14 Aug 2014)
    - Changed PP filter from <=0.01 to <0.9

version 0.7 lean (13 Aug 2013)
    - Reduced RAM usage. (< 100 Mb when looking for rare coding variants in exome)
    - This is done by adding function vcf2tsvLean in vcf.py to exclude lines instead of adding them 
      to TSV object

version 0.7 (12 Aug 2013)
    - Fixed a bug from the order of genotypes  'child/mother/father'
    Details: Python was sorting the dictionary keys and  hence father used to appear before mother 
    (F letter before M). The error was in the last two lines of "createMatrix" function.
    
version 0.5 (28 Jan 2013)
    - Change the genotype order from (child/father/mother) to (child / mother / father)
    
version 0.4 (29 Nov 2012)
    - Accept gender information (male or female child) to process X-chr appropriately.
    - Add explict inheritance  model for
        * Autosomal chromosomes and PAR regions on X chr
        * X-chr in males
        * X-chr in females
    - Define PAR regions
    - Previously we had summary table for AR, AD, and AR_CompHet for autosomal chromosomes including
     Y and X. Now, we will add another table for X-chr (either female or male child)

version 0.3 (10 Jan 2012)
    - Move many functions to Parser.py and use it as superclass for Trio class
    - Add optional output for child/mother/father genotype. option -g

version 0.2 (22 Dec 2011)
    - Add support for R output (AR = 1, AR_dbHET = 2 and AD = 3) at first column.
    - Correct compund HET function (remove if all comes from one parent or
      if both has all HETs in child)

version 0.1 (16 Dec 2011)
