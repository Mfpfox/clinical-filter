Clinical filtering for trios

Find variants in affected children that might contribute to their disorder. We
load VCF files (either named on the command line, or listed in a PED file) for
members of a family, filter for rare, functionally disruptive variants, and
assess whether each variant might affect the child's disorder. We take into 
account the parents genotypes (if available) and whether the parents are also
affected with a (the?) disorder. For variants in known disease causative genes
we check whether the inheritance patterns matches one expected for the  
inheritance models of the gene.
