EVAR (Exome Variant Analysis Report) for trios

Given three VCF files of a trio, return child variants under autosomal recessive (AR), autosomal 
recessive with compound heterozygotes (AR_dbHET), and autosomal dominant (AD) models of inheritance.

step 1) create search space by using filters from filters.txt
step 2) create trees based on user defined hierarchy and boundaries in hierarchy.txt
step 3) print report
        a) basic information (data, input files, filters, hierarchies, etc )
        b) Counts of each group under AR, AR_dbHET and AD models
        c) Under each model (AR, AR_dbHET and AD) for each group , print its
           variants (only column defined by the user in output.txt)
